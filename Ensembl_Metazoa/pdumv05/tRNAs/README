# Platynereis dumerilii genome version 0.5 tRNA gene annotation

## Summary
transfer RNA models were predicted using tRNAscan-SE v2.0. The analysis was run locally on a macOS system. Input files included
the 'platy.falcon.fa' genome assembly. 

## Note(s)
The tRNA-introns-gff3 file was not used for the Ensembl_Metazoa data upload. This is because the exon information
alone is sufficient to display the data.
