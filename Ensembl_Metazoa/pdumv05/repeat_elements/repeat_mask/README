# Repeat Masking 'protocol'

## Note(s)
Currently, the data output containing all the repeat elements and their positions along the genome are too
large to be hosted in this repository. For that reason, please contact kevin.mutemi@embl.de if you are 
interested in this file. 

Otherwise, the output files distributed to Ensembl Metazoa for the repeat element
annotations are: platy.falcon.fa.out, RE-pdumgenomev05.gff3
