# README

## Summary
This folder contains all the raw RNA-seq reads used to map against the 'platy.falcon.fa.masked' genome
assembly; to allow for ease in visualising the raw-read mapping via Ensembl Metazoa. For all Illumina reads,
the STAR algorithm was used. In brief, we used the developmental RNA-seq dataset from the JÃ©kely Lab, 
as well as tissue-specific datasets generated in the Arendt and Tessmar-Raible and Raible Labs, whereas 
long-read transcriptomes were generated from Tomancak's lab.

All data is labelled accordingly so that the appropriate credit is given. For transcriptome mapping, see the
transcriptome folder which has specific details of the RNA-seq data utilised to model genes.
