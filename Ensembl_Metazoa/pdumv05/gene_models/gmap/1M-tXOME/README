# A README text file describing the files in this directory

## Overview
GMAP-GSNAP was used to map a Trinity built 1 million transcriptome (named so due to the approximate number of transcripts
in this transcriptome) to the draft genome assembly i.e. 'platy.falcon.fa'. Default settings were used. 

Due to the size of the GMAP output files, the files are gunzip(d) using tar -zvcf option to facilitate downloads. Instead,
we include a summary text file describing the 'main' features of the mapping.

Updates to follow...
