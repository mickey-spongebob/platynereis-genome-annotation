# Platynereis dumerilii genome version 0.5 gene-models README file

## Summary
Several pipelines were tried and tested to attempt building gene models from different transcriptomes incl.
JÃ©kely labs' life-cycle transcriptome, tissue-specific RNA-seq datasets from the Arendt lab and long-read
PacBio sequencing from Tomancak's lab. The two pipelines that we thought to be ideal in modelling gene 
structures from the current assembly include GMAP and PASA. 

Briefly, for the GMAP analyses, an annotated transcriptome (~1 million) and previously annotated full-length
mRNA sequences were aligned against the genome to gain coordinates of transcripts. We used this annotated
transcriptome mapping dataset to compare against the PASA pipeline to manually curate reproducible gene
structures as well as naming the genes based on the transcript ID given by BLAST against proteome databases.

As for the PASA analysis, we followed the PASA pipeline developed by Brian Haas and colleagues. Custom code
is included in the appropriate folder.
