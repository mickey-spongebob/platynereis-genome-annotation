# This .txt file documents the filenames for files used for analysis or annotation
# Files for and/or derived from specific analyses can be found in appropriate directories in repository

## Note
As the genome annotation pipeline can produce several gigabytes (GB) of data, we reasoned that only small files relevant
for the analysis would be shared in this repository. Ideally integrating the data with appropriate online servers such as 
PdumBase would be best, however, the data is not in that state yet - but we fully intend to do so soon. To access specific
datasets regarding the genome annotation, please send an email to "kevin.mutemi@embl.de".

## Genome assembly files
There are currently three files of note that have been used for assessing genome assembly quality (see 'platynereis-genome-
assembly' repository). As of 09th June 2020, the best draft assembly consists of:
  
  platy.falcon.fa. # FALCON assembly of the PacBio long-read genome sequencing of a single male animal (germline + somatic DNA)
  
  platy.falcon.fa.masked # Soft-masked and/or Hard-masked using the Repeat-Scout+Modeler algorithms
  
## Transcriptome files
A collection of 'transcriptomes' are currently being used to map to the genomes so as to model gene structures. These include:

  super_tXOME # Trinity assembled transcriptome from Gaspar Jekely's developmental RNA-seq sampling, as well as additional
              # RNA-seq reads generated from the Arendt Lab. The isoforms were also concatenated so as to create 'super' 
              # transcripts (see Trinity webpage).
  
  GenBank 359 full-length CDS (complete mRNA sequences for Platynereis dumerilii)
  
  IsoSeq PacBio # PacBio long-read transcriptome sequencing
                # This dataset was generated by Pavel Tomancak's lab (Bruno Cossermeli Vellutini and Mette Handberg-Thorsager)
