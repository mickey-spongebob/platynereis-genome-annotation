# A README text file describing the files in this directory

## Overview
GMAP-GSNAP was used to map a annotated P. dumerilii full-length mRNA sequences to the draft genome assembly i.e. 
'platy.falcon.fa'. Default settings were used. 

Due to the size of the GMAP output files, the files are gunzip(d) using tar -zvcf option to facilitate downloads. Instead,
we include a summary text file describing the 'main' features of the mapping.

Updates to follow...
