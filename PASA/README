# A README file for the PASA pipeline ran to acquire gene models for Platynereis dumerilii

## Summary
Several transcriptomes were used to align/map against the draft assembly 'platy.falcon.fa.softmasked'
including PacBio IsoSeq from the Tomancak lab (Bruno Vellutini and Mette Handberg-Thorsager), as well as
Illumina-based transcriptome from the Jekely lab. Previously annotated mRNA full-length sequences were also
used to generate gene models.
